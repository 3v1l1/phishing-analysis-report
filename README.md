# Phishing Analysis Report

This repository contains a beginner-level phishing analysis report created as part of my
learning toward a cybersecurity and SOC analyst role. The purpose of this report is to
demonstrate how phishing attacks are identified, analyzed, and handled from a security
analyst perspective.

## What Is Phishing?

Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers impersonate a trusted entity to
trick users into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials, financial
details, or personal data.

Phishing attacks commonly occur through:
- Emails
- Text messages (SMS phishing / smishing)
- Fake websites
- Social media messages

---

## Common Characteristics of Phishing Attacks

Typical indicators of phishing include:
- Urgent or threatening language
- Requests for sensitive information
- Suspicious sender email addresses
- Unexpected attachments or links
- Misspellings or poor grammar
- Links that do not match legitimate domains

## Example Phishing Scenario

**Scenario:**
A user receives an email claiming to be from a bank, stating that their account will be
suspended unless immediate action is taken.

**Observed Red Flags:**
- Sense of urgency and fear
- Generic greeting instead of the user's real name
- Link redirecting to a suspicious website
- Request to enter login credentials

## Analyst Investigation Steps

A cybersecurity analyst would take the following steps:

1. Examine the sender's email address and headers
2. Inspect links without clicking them
3. Check the message content for social engineering tactics
4. Verify the legitimacy of the request with the organization
5. Classify the email as phishing if indicators are confirmed

## Potential Impact of a Successful Phishing Attack

If successful, phishing attacks can result in:
- Credential theft
- Unauthorized access to systems
- Financial loss
- Data breaches
- Damage to organizational reputation

---

## Recommended Response Actions

Basic response steps include:
- Reporting the phishing email to the security team
- Blocking the sender and malicious links
- Educating users about phishing awareness
- Monitoring systems for suspicious activity

---

## Why This Matters for a SOC Analyst

Phishing attacks are one of the most common threats handled by Security Operations Centers
(SOCs). Analysts must be able to quickly identify phishing attempts, assess risk, and take
appropriate action to protect users and systems.

This report demonstrates foundational analyst thinking and threat analysis skills.
